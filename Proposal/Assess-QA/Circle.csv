This role has started out on voluntary (unpaid) basis, but requires now substantial work-effort of about 30 hours a month and needs to be funded (it is all about documenting and maintaining the work of the CATALYST CIRCLE in the correponding GitHub repository). 

According to my personal profesional experience, these type of work is absolutely essential for collaborative organizations - therefore my full support.",5,"The proposer, Stephen Whitenstall, has 30 years experience in organizing academic, community and business projects and is deeply engaged within CATALYST CIRCLE and SWARM. 

Major elements of the proposal already exist and are heavily used. The proposal is mainly about the ongoing work of documenting and sharing the work of the CATALYST CIRCLE. 

What I can judge, usage and adoption are therefore highly secured - therefore my full support.",5,"The proposer has outlined the costs, roadmap and major elements of the work behind this proposal. All is based on already happening (currently voluntary) activities, which need to be fairly funded now.

It may not be straightforward to everyone how documentation and more generally, information contribute to decision making, nevertheless, in time it should become clearer to Cardano supporters that documentation and information are fundamental for decision making in technological innovation, software development, and blockchain governance. This project does a very efficient job, founded by actual work done, in demonstrating how documentation for oversight can be achieved. Outside of the scope of the current proposal, I would recommend that the proponent considers how oversight will relate in the future to implementation (i.e.: sanctioning corrupt or inefficient behavior). The reason for this suggestion is that in the long run, oversight without sanctions/control would eventually become useless. Thank you for your proposal and good luck.",5,Yes. The proponent provides us with confidence to support the project by having already demonstrated it without the precious economic undersigning. This is an example of innovation through execution and iteration.,5,"Yes. The proposal provides not only the information necessary to audit it but also the tools (links) to do so. In addition, the proponent has demonstrated availability and responsiveness to the Catalyst community. I highly recommend that if the proposal is funded, the proponent pay great attention to the automation and future decentralization of the oversight tools. It will be highly desirable that in the future, the tools developed here for project oversight can be transferred to other community members, to other projects, to future generations, and to decentralized communities. To achieve this, it seems desirable that the processes of documenting activities, publishing and disseminating will be as automated as possible and independent from individual human skills and dispositions (e.g.: going from automatic note-taking i.e.: 'subtitles generation', to social media posting).",5,,,

Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook is a repository of important information about Catalyst Swarm and Catalyst. The maintenance and curation of live sessions and information about Catalyst allows for a channel of aggregation and redirection of the community, important aspects to educate and inform the community, which consequently helps to maintain cohesion and mitigate information fragmentation, providing a channel where people can learn about Catalyst and know where to look for more information. Gitbook maintenance also allows for asynchronous communication, enabling the community to access content from previous sessions in the future. 

No metrics/KPIs related to the material to be cataloged were presented, which I consider important for impact assessment. I would recommend establishing some targets for the amount of material to be archived.",4,"The proposer has been carrying out the work voluntarily for a few months and by looking at the Gitbook it is possible to check the quality of the work developed.

Distributed decision making was one of the reasons that Catalyst Circle was created and is composed of 7 members from different sectors of the community. These members are representatives of large groups and different interests. Maintaining coordination across such a large community and with such broad and diverse interests makes the Catalyst Circle role essential to Cardano's governance. This proposal seeks to document, monitor and communicate information from the Catalyst Circle, so I see huge potential impact for the challenge. 

It was established that the proposal will maintain documentation, monitoring and communication of information for 6 months, and an estimate of 27 hours per month was established for the fulfillment of these activities. These goals indicate a positive and evident impact on the challenge.

As a Catalysts participant for several months i have seen Swarm starting to establish into a dependable hub. As such this proposal will help add value to the community and is worth funding. 

The piece i would have liked to have seen in this proposal is how the GitHub and Swarm aligns with the catalyst circle, IOG you tube channel and the catalyst community site (dev.projectcatalyst.org) along with others. There is some duplication of content (eg TH slides). As part of the marketing it would be good to how Swarm differentiates itself and the boundaries within which it works.",5,"I have validated the time estimates for maintenance and marketing with someone who does this for a living and they both make sense.

eg. 
- x link through from social media to gitbook 
- no of visits to gitbook 
- no of new attendees to swarm sessions - referred via the marketing campaign 

the risks should also be called out. There are 2 i see that require mitigation: 
1. Stephen is no longer able to maintain the gitbook or drive the social media updates

Also, there are more proposals which are addressing the previous proposal, rather than the challenge, therefore, it would be nice to have another special :fund: where you can increase the budget for the previous proposals, due to the growth, or changes which increase extra work. 

From this perspective, this proposal is NOT addressing the fund challenge, because it is addressing another proposal that addressed the challenge effectively in the previous fund, so this one is addressing it indirectly.

I fully agree that this work allows the community to make easier decisions by enabling them to get the information they are looking for.

Outsourcing and funding the administrative element of this role is generally scalable, however, you will likely have to keep adding resources if we want to truly impact the community on a global scale. This is still however, a good starting point. Any voter who understands the challenges and the whole point of the Catalyst Circle should be able to see the value in this and be able to vote effectively on it.

if you don't have some form of objective checks, you can operate on a cliff edge and not even realise it. 
So the function is important. Having too many checks can be counterproductive - and it is usually because the processes are not continuously reviewed objectively. 
Therefore as the recording/record keeping is very operational and administratively tedious and time consuming - its definitely necessary to manage that cliff edge risk.",5,"I do see that a next round of funding will help to establish this needed function more.

1) To facilitate communication between the different functional groups

3) To suggest improvements on plans and processes that shape Project Catalyst

The plan presented is clear, well laid out, and shows that a lot of thought has already gone into this. The links provided by the proposer also strengthen it overall by providing additional information, however the proposal itself is strong as a stand alone for voters who may not have the time/will to look at all the links. 
In addition, the budget being requested seems more than fair for this work and doesn't capture free work he has already put in.",5,"The reason I am not giving this criteria a 5 is because I would like to see more information at each of the milestones. For example, the proposer highlights that sustainability is a key component of this work and that sponsorships are being sought, but I think more information could be provided here. What type of sponsorships? Would the idea to have others eventually do the Gitbook? There is also no real contingency should something happen to the one proposer. If say he gets sick, or something happens that pulls him away, what will happen?
