### The problem : How to maintain Community Oversight

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Catalyst Circle Oversight GitBook ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/ ) has been maintained since July 11th 2021. It documents and tracks the activities of the Catalyst Circle a initiative started by IOHK to advance governance in Project Catalyst.

At present this oversight is being maintained on a voluntary unpaid basis and takes approx 27 hours a month to complete ( see the weekly breakdown of hours worked below). This level of commitment is not sustainable in the medium term without being resourced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### The solution: Resourced Community Oversight documentation, tracking & communication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once funded, the Catalyst Circle Oversight GitBook will improve distributed decision making within the next two Catalyst rounds by documenting, tracking & communicating the activities, discussions and decisions of Catalyst Circle thereby making it more transparent and accessible to all.

The GitBook is maintained by QA-DAO ( https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/ ) in collaboration with Catalyst Circle and the Cardano & Project Catalyst communities. All content recorded is open source and licensed under Apache 2.0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Secretary / Facilitator

This proposal is separate from the Catalyst Circle Secretary / Facilitator roles. And does not include any associated costs. All documentation and tracking described in this proposal is independent of Catalyst Circle resources.

### A live record of additions to the GitBook

A live record of additions to the GitBook back end GitHub repository can be seen here ( https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/Catalyst-Circle/graphs/contributors?from=2021-07-11&to=2021-09-01&type=a).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Tracking the time spent on maintaining the GitBook

In order to provide a realistic estimate of resource requirements QA-DAO has been tracking the time spent on maintaining the GitBook. The raw Clockify data to 30th August 2021 can be found here ( https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/Catalyst-Circle-Co-ordination/blob/main/Documents/Clockify_Detailed_Report_01_01_2021-31_12_2021(1).csv).

A total of 27:40 hours have been spent to the 30th August 2021. Time was spent in July 2021 setting up the GitBook and documenting an extensive problem sensing exercise conducted by Catalyst Circle. It is estimated that a minimum of 27 hours will required to cover the current expansion of Catalyst Circle activities and initiatives.

A shift to note-taking on a proprietary platform inhibited documentation and tracking for Circle Meetings 3 and 4. More time will be allocated in September 2021 to resolve this issue.

### Roadmap ( Definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months)

Prior to funding

Catalyst Circle Version 1 - July 2021 to October 2021

Documentation and tracking can be completed and is live.

3 months

Catalyst Circle Version 2 -  November 2021 to January 2022

Catalyst Circle Version 2 roughly coincides with the release of Fund 6 (November 2022).

Once funded Catalyst Circle Oversight will aim to communicate its documentation and tracking via social media in order to reach a wider audience.

6 months

Catalyst Circle Version 3 - February 2022 to April 2022 (?)

If Catalyst Circle Version 3 proceeds it will roughly coincide with the release of Fund 7 (February 2022).

Documentation and tracking will be supplemented with commentary. Sponsorships will be sought.

12 months

Catalyst Circle Version 4+ - May 2022 to September 2022 (?)

In the long term any oversight should be self-sustaining and sponsorships will be sought to achieve this aim.
